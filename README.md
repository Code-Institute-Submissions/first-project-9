## Testing 

__Navigation Bar__

The navigation bar has links for the home, status, FAQ and contact page which stays identical on every page for easy navigation and works even when the screen gets smaller. On mobile screens the navigation bar changes to being underneath the logo instead of next to it.

__Landing Section__
The landing section has a circle in the middle of it. In this circle you can choose to add the bot to your discord server or go to the feature showcase, which is on the same page but underneath the landing section. Whenever the screen gets smaller this circle responds by growing smaller together with all the content inside of it.

__Footer__
The footer provides links to status, contact, faq and support server. It also contains a copyright mark together with the sites logo. The footer responds to smaller screens by sorting its content in a list like manner.

__Status Page__
The status page allows the user to see whenever the bot is offline or online. The box hosting the status of the bot responds to smaller screens by growing smaller in width to make sure it always stays in frame.

__FAQ__
The FAQ page answers the most frequently asked questions. One of the questions is answered through a video instead of text. The page responds to smaller screens by going from two column to one.

__Contact Page__
The contact page provides contact informations to users incase they would ever need it. As the status page, the contact page grows smaller in width whenever the screen gets smaller.
